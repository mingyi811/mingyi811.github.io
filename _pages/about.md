I am a fourth-year undergraduate student from the School of Statistics and Data Science, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (SUFE). I am fortunate to work closely with <a href="https://statr.me/about/" target="_blank">Prof. Yixuan Qiu</a> and <a href="https://www.tengjiaye.com/" target="_blank">Prof. Jiaye Teng</a> at SUFE, and with <a href="https://ying531.github.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Ying Jin</a> at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania.

My research focuses on developing statistical methodology for ML or AI models, combining theoretical rigor and practical application. Recently, I mainly work on uncertainty quantification with conformal prediction methods.



## Research Experience

\* denotes equal contribution.

### **Online Selective Conformal Prediction with Asymmetric Rules: A Permutation Test Approach** &nbsp; [[Preprint]](https://ying531.github.io/assets/files/PEMI_paper.pdf), [[Github]](https://github.com/mingyi811/PEMI)
**Mingyi Zheng**, Ying Jin

- Proposed a general permutation-based framework for constructing prediction sets with selection-conditional coverage under arbitrary asymmetric online selection rules.
- Developed a randomized version of the general algorithm and specialized algorithms for common selection rules to improve computational efficiency.
- Proved that both the general framework and each variant yield prediction sets that satisfy selection-conditional coverage in the finite-sample setting.



### **Smoothing-Based Conformal Prediction for Balancing Efficiency and Interpretability** &nbsp; [[Preprint]](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22529)
**Mingyi Zheng\***, Hongyu Jiang\*, Yizhou Lu\*, Jiaye Teng

- Proposed a smoothing-based framework for constructing prediction sets with better interpretability.
- Provided theoretical guarantees showing the validity of the prediction sets and bounds on the prediction sets size and number.



### **Differentiable Meta Learning via Auto-Learned Loss Functions** (*Working in progress*)
**Mingyi Zheng\***, Baiying Xin\*, Yixuan Qiu

- Developed a bilevel optimization framework for automatically learning loss functions.
- Developed an efficient algorithm for backward optimization under our framework.
