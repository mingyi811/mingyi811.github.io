I am a fourth-year undergraduate student from the School of Statistics and Data Science, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (SUFE). I am fortunate to work closely with <a href="https://statr.me/about/" target="_blank">Prof. Yixuan Qiu</a> and <a href="https://www.tengjiaye.com/" target="_blank">Prof. Jiaye Teng</a> at SUFE, and with <a href="https://ying531.github.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Ying Jin</a> at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania.

My research focuses on developing statistical methodology for ML or AI models, combining theoretical rigor and practical application. Recently, I mainly work on uncertainty quantification with conformal prediction methods.
